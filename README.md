# WWDC22 Submission - My Stack

## Status: Accepted!

This is my playground for WWDC22's [Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/). I decided to create a Swift Playground to show some of the services I self-host.

## Installation

Download the `MyStack.swiftpm`, and run it in Xcode 13.3 on macOS 12.3.
